This is a **template repository** that is meant to be used as a base or example
for your own project. To get started, just click the <kbd>Use this
template</kbd> button in the top left of this repository page and edit the
`main.ts` file to customize your new Bun-based GitHub Action. There's no
`node_modules/`, no `dist/`, and no compile step. How's that for ease-of-use! üòâ

After instantiating this template repository, you will need to manually do the
following:

1. Write your code in the `main.ts` file. You can use npm packages without
   installing them, `node:` builtins, and even `Bun.*` APIs.
2. Make sure you edit the `.github/workflows/test-action.yml` test workflow if
   you want to test any additional inputs or scenarios.
3. Replace the `LICENSE` file with your preferred software license. Check out
   [choosealicense.com] if you're unsure of which one to pick.
4. Replace this `README.md` file with a fancy readme to suit your new GitHub
   Action. Make sure you document all your inputs & outputs!
5. Create a new Release (with **no build step**) on GitHub Releases and publish
   your new GitHub Action to the [GitHub Actions Marketplace]! üöÄ

You'll notice that the example code takes advantage of [Auto-install] to use npm
packages without specifying them in `package.json`. You can specify a version of
a package to use by adding each package you use to your `package.json` or
`bun.lockb`.
